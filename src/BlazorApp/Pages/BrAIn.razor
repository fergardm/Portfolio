    <p>The brain is a highly complex organ, characterized by intricate interactions among its cells, structures and regions. A diverse array of pathologies or conditions often triggers a cascade of structural and physiological changes in brain tissues. Beyond direct effects on neurons, there are other key elements whose alterations also contribute to brain disease, among them the brain vasculature and microglia. Therefore, changes in their organization and integrity may be assumed as fingerprints of tissue atrophy and dysfunction. However, the analysis of morphological and topological changes resulting from brain disease remains a challenge. Most current data mainly derive from two-dimensional (2D) image analysis coupled to a wide spectrum of molecular assays, which provide limited insight into microglia-vasculature interactions in disease. </p>
